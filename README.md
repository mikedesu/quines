# quines in C

this is my personal quines in C folder.

recently i added a utility to help make it easier to both write and compile these quines.

```
./build.sh <input.c> <output.c>
```

This allows you to focus on writing quines, and not on the annoying process of shoving the program into the string.

The quines in this folder all work in general, and each represents a sort-of "evolution" on the previous one.

With time, I hope to compose some very ridiculous programs.

Thank you for your support.
